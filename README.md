    <kbd> <img width="1000" alt="bref" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buddymar/Hotel-Reservation-Cancellation/main/assets/Database%20Diagram.png"> </kbd> <br>
</p>

<br>

## üìå **Data Integration**

We will use SQL joins to create a new dataset by incorporating new data from all other tables into the `hotel_dataset` table.

</p>

<br>

## üìå **Data Preprocessing**

### Missing Values

Before begin the analysis, we need to ensure that all missing values are addressed. We'll start by identifying all features with missing values and then handle them using the most appropriate method.

Table 1 ‚Äî Missing Values
 **Column** | **Total Missing Values** | **Handling Missing Values**
-----------------|--------------|--------------|
company | 112593 | The missing values in the `company` feature will be filled with **0**, as these values indicate that the distribution channel for this particular guest is not a company.
agent | 16340 | The missing values in the `agent` feature will also be filled with **0**, for the same reason as above.
city | 488 | For the `children` feature, missing values will be filled with **0**, as this indicates that the guest did not bring any children with them.
children | 4 | The missing values in the `city` feature will be filled with **unknown,** as there is no other method available to determine the guest's city of origin.

<br>

### Data Anomaly

In this section, we will filter out abnormal data from the dataset related to hotel reservations. This process ensures that the analysis relies on valid and reliable information.

### 1. Reservation Without Guests

<br>

### Travel Agent/Tour Operator

<p align="center">
    <kbd> <img width="1000" alt="share" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buddymar/Hotel-Reservation-Cancellation/main/assets/agent1.png"> </kbd> <br>
</p>

**Key Points:**
- **The top 10 agents with the highest cancellation ratios at city hotels all have cancellation rates above 70%. Remarkably, the top 3 agents even exhibit a 100% cancellation rate**.
- **Agent 9 has the highest number of reservations (31849) and ranks first in terms of total reservations**. This agent seems to bring in a significant amount of business to the City Hotel. **However, Agent 9 also has a relatively high cancellation rate (41.62%)**, which might be a concern for the hotel's revenue management. Despite bringing in a large number of reservations, a high cancellation rate can lead to revenue loss and operational inefficiencies.
- Agents with lower rankings in terms of total reservations might still contribute positively to the hotel's revenue if they have lower cancellation rates. For example, **Agent 28 ranks sixth in terms of total reservations but has a relatively low cancellation rate (6.71%), indicating a more stable and reliable booking pattern**.
- Among the top 10 agents with the highest total reservations at city hotels, **agents 1 and 19** also rank in the top 10 agents with the highest cancellation rates.
